One of my main principle is fast, no bloat and less overhead. Almost everything can be
achieved in less possible keybinds. Unless there is a major change in my dots I wll not
update this :))


Remaps
```
Caps <-> Ctrl
```

main keybinds
```
SUPER+S+Ret - bemenu
M+RET       - foot
SUPER+Ret   - foot
  C-S-n - spawn new foot
  C-S-b - find visit link
SUPER+d     - google/github/ddg/...
SUPER+x     - logout/reboot/shutdown
SUPER-l     - battery status
```

aliases
```
n = nnn ;; check nnn/config for nnn keybinds
v = helix
C-x = fg
py = python
emacs keybinds works in zsh
```

Note that I use external monitor and keyboard with my laptop so I've disabled my built
in keyboard in udev and monitor in hyprland.
